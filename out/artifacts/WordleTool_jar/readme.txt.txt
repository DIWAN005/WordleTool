To setup the game, please enter your channel name in all lowercase letters and navigate to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to generate an OAuth code. 
Copy this value (including the oauth:) and use that as the code on the setup page.

Click enter to start the game. If you do not see the message "Hello, I'm StreamyWordle! To play, type !sw and your 5-letter guess separated by a space."
in your chat, please restart the StreamyWordle app.

Playing StreamyWordle is easy! Pull up the application and simply have your chat type in !sw and their 5-letter guess separated by a space. 
After a period of 60 seconds, the guess with the highest percentage of users guessing that word will be played. Once the game has been completed,
simply press the Enter or Play Again button to restart a new game.


Current known bugs:
- Play again button does replace the enter button on the second and all subsequent game over screens, however the enter button has the same functionality.
- Duplicate letters in user guess will repetitively appear regardless of the number of letters in the correct answer.
  - For example, if the user guess is GRASS and the answer is STARE, the two S's in GRASS will be colored orange, even though there is one S in the correct
    answer.
